/*
     This class represents the refrigerator data structure.
     It should be given a capacity as an integer via the constructor.
     If attempting to add a new product exceeds the maximum volume allowed,
     the new product should not be added.
     For simplification, the volume is to be treated in the imaginary unit VU (volume unit).

     Furthermore, the class should have a memory for products stored in the refrigerator.

     Instance methods still need to be attached to the refrigerator class.
     The following methods should definitely be included:
     - A method for determining the free capacity
     - A method for determining the capacity already consumed
     - A method for determining the number of stored products
     - A method for finding the product with the smallest volume
     - A method for finding the product with the largest volume
     - A method to add new products
     - A method to remove existing products
     - A method to remove all existing products
     - A method to remove all expired products
     - A method to sort the products by expiry date
